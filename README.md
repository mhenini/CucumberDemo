# CucumberDemo
Simple demo on how to use Cucumber for Java to create BDD scenarios.

Based on the tutorial provided by Cucumber. Please see https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/overview/ for more information on Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) and Cucumber.

Note: This demo uses Gradle for the build tool instead of Maven like the original Cucumber tutorial. For more information on how to use Cucumber with Gradle please see https://www.baeldung.com/java-cucumber-gradle for an example.
